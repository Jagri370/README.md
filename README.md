#### Description:

This project is an interactive quiz application designed to help users learn basic Japanese. The quiz offers three different choices:

1. **Days of the Week in Japanese**:  
   In this section, a random day of the week will be displayed in Japanese. You are required to translate it into English. If you get it wrong, the program will inform you that your answer is incorrect and provide the correct translation.

2. **Numbers 1 through 10 in Japanese**:  
   This section will present a random number from 1 to 10 in Japanese. You need to write the correct English translation of the number. For example, if the number shown is "1", you should write "Ichi". If your answer is correct, the program will confirm it; if it's wrong, the program will notify you of the incorrect answer and give the correct translation.

3. **Exit the Quiz**:  
   If you choose this option, the quiz will exit, and the session will end.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to practice the days of the week and basic numbers in Japanese. It provides immediate feedback to help users improve their language skills.
