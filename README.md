#### Description:

This project is an interactive command-line quiz application designed to help beginners learn basic Japanese language skills. It focuses on two essential areas of learning: **the days of the week** and **numbers from 1 to 10**. The quiz is simple yet engaging, providing users with random prompts and immediate feedback. The goal of the quiz is to reinforce vocabulary retention while allowing learners to test and improve their knowledge of basic Japanese.

The quiz has three distinct choices that guide users through different sections:

1. **Days of the Week in Japanese**:  
   This section helps users familiarize themselves with the Japanese names for the days of the week. The quiz will randomly present one of the seven days of the week in Japanese. The user will need to type the corresponding English translation. For example, if the program presents "Getsuyoubi", the user should type "Monday."  
   - If the answer is correct, the program will confirm it.
   - If the answer is incorrect, the program will notify the user and provide the correct English translation.

2. **Numbers 1 through 10 in Japanese**:  
   In this section, the quiz will randomly select a number between 1 and 10 in Japanese. The user will be asked to provide the English translation for that number. For example, if the program presents "San", the user should type "three".  
   - A correct answer will be confirmed with a positive message.
   - An incorrect answer will prompt the program to display the correct translation for the number.

3. **Exit the Quiz**:  
   If the user chooses to exit, the program will end the quiz session. This choice gives users control over when they wish to stop the quiz and ensures that they can exit gracefully if needed.

#### Features:
- **Interactive User Experience**: The quiz provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily select the quiz section and participate in the test.
- **Immediate Feedback**: After each answer, the program gives immediate feedback on whether the response was correct or incorrect. If incorrect, the correct answer is displayed, reinforcing learning.
- **Randomized Prompts**: Each quiz section selects random items (days of the week or numbers), ensuring that users are tested on various aspects of the language each time they take the quiz.
- **Simple Navigation**: The quiz is straightforward, making it accessible for users of all skill levels, especially beginners who are starting to learn Japanese.

#### Learning Goals:
- **Reinforce Basic Vocabulary**: The quiz is designed to help users quickly learn and reinforce the names of the days of the week and the numbers from 1 to 10 in Japanese.
- **Test Memory and Recall**: Through random prompts, users are encouraged to recall Japanese words from memory, strengthening their language retention skills.
- **Encourage Active Participation**: The interactive nature of the quiz encourages users to actively participate in their language learning journey.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language**: The quiz is implemented using Python, making it easy to run on any platform with Python installed.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The user interacts with the quiz through the terminal, providing a simple and accessible interface for users to test their knowledge.

#### Future Improvements:
- **Expanded Vocabulary**: Future versions could add more sections to the quiz, such as more numbers, common phrases, or even hiragana and katakana practice.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A GUI version could be developed for users who prefer a more visual, user-friendly interface.
- **Leaderboard or Score Tracking**: Adding a scoring system or leaderboard to track progress could make the quiz more competitive and motivating for users.

This project is an excellent resource for anyone starting their Japanese language learning journey, especially those interested in mastering basic vocabulary related to time and numbers. By regularly testing their knowledge through this quiz, users can build a strong foundation in the language.
